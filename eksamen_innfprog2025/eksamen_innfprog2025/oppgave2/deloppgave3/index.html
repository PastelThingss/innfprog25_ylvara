<!--The script here is for connecting the css and ul and li together. so you would get the every other line is 50px height and have the grey background color-->

//there is two segments in this chain which is the css and the height, they both are applied when the list element is a odd number
        $('li:odd').css('background-color', '#d3d3d3').height(50);
